Plugins for music player __Exaile__:

- __search-on-internet__ - search title on the internet (Google.com, YouTube.com, Vimeo.com, Wrzuta.pl)

  ![#1](images/exaile-search-on-internet-1.png?raw=true)   
  
  It is usefull to search songs from radio stations (to download and listen again).

- __testing__ - test some elements from source code of exaile and other plugins to learn how to write own plugin.

    I try to learn:
    - what menus are available
    - how to get access to current playing track 
    - how to add item in context menu on playlist
    - how to add submenu in context menu on playlist (and have access to selected files)
    - how to get selected track name and open in browser
    - how to get selected track name and save in text file

On Linux put in user's folder

    ~/.local/share/exaile/plugins
    
so you get 
    
    ~/.local/share/exaile/plugins/search-on-internet/PLUGININFO
    ~/.local/share/exaile/plugins/search-on-internet/__init__.py

or

    ~/.local/share/exaile/plugins/testing/PLUGININFO
    ~/.local/share/exaile/plugins/testing/__init__.py
    
(_tested on Linux Mint 18.2 based on Ubuntu 16.04_)
